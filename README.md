## Fibonacci-Sequence

# The Fibonacci Sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.

## The difference in the loop and recursion model

# The loop model puts out the first 12 numbers in the sequence and have a faster runtime .
# The recursion model puts out the 11th number of the sequence and have a slower runtime vs the loop because it have to go into itself so many times.

# The Big O Notation for this algorithm and how you arrive at that conclusion
